### Pipeline Overview

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

1) data_prep.ipynb
    a) Pull subset of images from google maps. 
        N = 10,000,000? Let's limit to >100GB
        i) Currently using a small dataset from Kaggle with 10k images. 
            This can be generalized easily once we have our full dataset.
    b) Prune only European locations
    c) Convert into whichever data format will be used by each model.
2) Training pipeline
