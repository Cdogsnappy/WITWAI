## Motivations
[GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) is a web-based game wherein the player is dropped into random places in the world and is given visual information via Google Street View. Using the information presented, the player must make a guess as to the coordinates of the image by placing a pin on the globe.

Due to the game's popularity, a competitive scene has arisen in which certain players have become more or less experts at GeoLocation. They have played many games and tend to be capable at:
1. Identifying language or script
2. Identifying biome have internalized distinguishing features 

Website:

The final project report must be submitted to Canvas as a website. The website must include:

- Project title and team members
- Link to presentation slides
- Link to github repository.
- Intro presenting and motivating the problem
- Your methodology (method, data, evaluation metrics). If applicable, highlight how it differs from prior work (new experiments, new methods, etc)
- Discussion of quantitative results
- (Important) Demos of your approach.
