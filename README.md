# WITWAI
Deep learning and computer vision to play GeoGuessr!

Website:

The final project report must be submitted to Canvas as a website. The website must include:

- Project title and team members
- Link to presentation slides
- Link to github repository.
- Intro presenting and motivating the problem
- Your methodology (method, data, evaluation metrics). If applicable, highlight how it differs from prior work (new experiments, new methods, etc)

# Methodology 

#### Overview 

We have implemented a multi-model pipeline in order to classify the country label of each image. This is utilizing an OCR text recognition model, a SotA LLM for language identification, an image segmentation model, and a deep feedforward network. All code is written in python, using either Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. Implementation of the FFNN is handled in PyTorch.
